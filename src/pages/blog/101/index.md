<p>The video below is the first video of the blog's new series: Super Dooper Shorts. I spend so much time shooting bits of video that aren't long enough to turn into a stand alone movie. This series is an attempt to give those clips a new home and provide more than just photographs to the stories of the outside. Here it is the first video of the series: Birthday Climb.</p>

<p>On August 3rd, 2016, I turned 26. On my endless quest to climb all of the peaks over 14,000 feet in Colorado, also referred to as 14ers, I decided to try to bag a 14er on my Birthday. My birthday is in some of the prime climbing season in Colorado, but with work, life, and family gatherings on my special day, it's hard to carve out time just for me and my adventure schedule. So I decided to take on the challenge of bag a peak, come into work, and hangout and celebrate with the friends all on my Birthday.</p>

<p>I choose what is arguably the easiest and most popular 14er for this challenge, Bierstadt. The trail for Bierstadt is only about 5 miles round trip and about an hour and half away from Denver making it the perfect peak, both for its difficulty and proximity from work. Hiking up the 14ers can be a serious drag when the trail is littered with people. Although I don't want to promote some sort of weird self-entitlement when it comes to getting outside, the experience of hiking a 14er is way more fun when there are less people. I figured not only did this 14er give me the best odds of completing my goal, but it was maybe the best way of hiking the peak itself. I would be hiking in the middle of the week, super early in the morning, giving me the highest odds of having an uncluttered trail.</p>

<p> I drove up the night before and slept in my car at the trailhead. As my alarm went off at 4:00am, and then again at 5:00am, and then finally at 5:15am; I began to wake up and climb out of the coziness of my sleeping bag. It was cold, wet, and best of all quiet at the trailhead. I didn't see a single soul on the run up that morning, accomplishing my goal of solitude on one of the busiest peaks in the state. As I ran up, my legs got soaked from the morning dew of the bushes as I trotted up the peak. At the summit the clouds and empty sky danced together, like two lovers engaging in an intimate tango. I was one of the first 3 people on the summit that day and at 7:30am and had accomplished my goal. As I ran down, smile running from ear to ear I bumped into maybe 20 or so parties climbing up, validating my decision making of this summit. With each passerby, my excitement of what I had done may have slipped out, but you know what, it felt like I had just accomplished more than just bagging another peak. I added unordinary to the adventure and made it more Oblong. So my fellow Oblongers when you are trying to do something on your outdoorsy bucket list, it's worth trying to make things more fun. Think about how can you make the mundane of how you approach the simple problems different and try to challenge yourself. This will be one of the easiest accents on my list 14er bucket list, but will also be one of the ones I remember the most.</p>

I followed all the direction on [14ers.com](https://www.14ers.com/route.php?route=evan2&peak=Evans+and+Bierstadt). This website is an invaluable resource if you did not know about it. It has everything from pictures and route descriptions to a forum to meet new hikers and climbers. I followed this post exactly on directions and information. I would just follow it when planning an accent.

**To get there:**

Just put Bierstadt in google maps. The app will take you to the trailhead. If that doesn't work checkout the directions below, it's pretty easy to get there.

- Take I-70W to exit 240
- Drive on Colorado 103 through the town of Georgetown to Echo Lake.
