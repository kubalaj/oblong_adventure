<h3>Description</h3>
Just a short one hour drive from Denver, Butler Gulch provides low angles, spectacular views, and access to a large variety of beginner backcountry terrain. Everything from tree skiing, to wide open Gulches, Butler Gulch should be on everyone's list for beginner terrain.

On December 29th, 2018, fresh from a road trip back home to Colorado, I was flooded with a influx of texts to go on a variety of touring trips. The state had been hit with an usual amount of early season snow and it doesn't take long around the holidays for the beacon of friends to lite.

My friends, Harry and Andrew suggested Butler Gulch for one of my homecoming ski tour debout. My expectations were low, but the rewards given were incredibly high. Butler Gulch, reminded me of many of the classic ski descents in Rocky Mountain National Park and I couldn't help but think I was transported to somewhere unworldly. With an easy commute on top beautiful terrain what's not to like?

To get there:

- Take I-70W to exit 232
- Take US-40W to Henderson Mine Rd. If you take the first turn going up Berthoud Pass you missed the turn.

We started the day with a sweltering -8 temps and a skin accompanied with a crowd consisting of snowmobilers, cross country skiers, dogs, and other backcountry skiers. If you are looking for an uncrowded secluded tour, skip this trip. The cold temps most likely kept most of the people out for the day, but even with subzero temps there were still maybe 20 or so people there starting the day with us.

Skinning up to the top of our first descent wasn't too physically demanding. Considering I was the slowest of the group, coming from a combination of sea level and a stressful desk job fitness level, it took us maybe 1-2 hours to get to the top of our first decent.

We spent the first run, as shown on the map, skiing a treed aspect with deep powder on skinners left. The trees, although tight, where spread out enough that there were no issues skiing between all the trees with almost no hazards; minus tree wells.

After one tree run we skinned up and made our way over to the bowls on skinners right. Here we were approached with more breathtaking views, as well as hurricane force winds. In each trough of the gullies you tour over expect the possibility of high winds as well as a slight chance of avalanche danger. The slope angels are low, but each gully is in play for avy terrain. We eventually stopped at the top of one of these gullies and skied down. Untracked 6-8 inches of snow meant with sunny days were a reminder of why conservative days are sometimes worth doing and just as fun as gnarly days. The open gully eventually constricts and turns into a tree run of similar characteristics as our first run. Just make sure, as you hit the trees, to hang skier's right to hook up with the skin trail and ski down to the trailhead.

Butler's Gulch is a treat that everyone trying to get into backcountry should consider. It offers tons of conservative options with high rewards. If you can mind the crowds and traffic expect spectacular days.
