<h3>Description:</h3>
Just a short hour drive from Denver, Butler Gulch provides low angles, spectacular views and access to a large variety of beginner terrain. Everything from tree skiing, to wide open Gulches Butler Gulch should be on everyone's list for beginner backcountry terrain.

On December 29th, 2018 my fresh from a Road Trip back home, back to where my love for the adventures all started, Colorado.

It doesn't take long around the holidays for the beacon of friends to suggest different trips. When my friend Harry and Andrew suggested Butler Gulch my expectations were low and the rewards where high. It reminded me of many of the classic ski descents in Rocky Mountain National Park. To get there:

- Take I-70W to exit 232
- Take US-40W to Henderson Mine Rd. If you take the first turn going up Berthoud Pass you missed the road.

We started the day with -8 degree temperatures and a skin accompanied with a crowd of snowmobilers, cross country skiers, and other backcountry skiers. The cold temps most likely kept most of the people out for the day, but there were still maybe 20 or so people there.

Skinning up there wasn't too much of a slog for the reward that you get. Considering I was the slowest coming from a combination of sea level and a stressful desk job, it took maybe 1-2 hours to get to the top.

We spend the first run as shown on the map skiing a treed aspect with deep powder. It was steep enough that it adds enjoyment and the trees were spread out enough it made for prime tree skiing. Getting fresh untracked tracks doesn't hurt either.

After one tree run we skinned up and made out way over to the bowls on skinners right. Here we were approached with more incredible views as well as almost hurricane force winds. In each gully you tour over expect the possibility of high winds as well as a slight chance of avalanche danger. After an even colder skin up, we stopped at the topish of one of these gullies and skied down. Untracked 6-8 inches of snow meant with sunny days were an incredible treat and make conservative days worth doing. After untreed skis you descend into more trees of similar characteristics as the run before. Just make sure to hang skier's right to hook up with the skin trail and ski down.

Butler's Gulch is a treat that everyone trying to get into backcountry should consider. It offers tons of conservative options with high rewards. If you can mind the crowds and traffic expect spectacular days.
